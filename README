Version 0.1
Author: Ian Collins (3n)


// DESCRIPTION

GrowingInput is a class for MooTools that will add auto-expanding to any input
or textarea element (as the user types the input grows to accommodate it).



// EXAMPLES

new GrowingInput($('id-of-input-or-textarea-element'))



// TODO

Get rid of "jerkiness" of expanding for INPUT tags. Also improve the size it 
gets set to so no characters are hidden on the front.
